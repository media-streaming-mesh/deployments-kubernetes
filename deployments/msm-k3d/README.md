# MSM K3D Setup

## Install K3D 

Follow the instructions on official docs https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/#installation 

or
	
```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash```

or
	
Mac users ```brew install k3d```


## What is k3d?
		
	k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

	k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.


## Create a cluster 

> k3d cluster create NAME [flags]

example for MSM with 2 Nodes and 1 Server: ```k3d cluster create msm --agents 2 --servers 1```

Test/Use the new Cluster

```kubectl cluster-info```

```kubectl get nodes```

## Copy Test Video to Docker Container (/tmp/ folder)

```docker cp {options} CONTAINER_ID:SRC_PATH DEST_PATH ```

example: ```docker cp video.mpeg CONTAINER_ID:/tmp/```

## Start MSM

Clone Deployment-Kubernetes Repo ```git clone git@github.com:media-streaming-mesh/deployments-kubernetes.git```. Follow the README in msm-demo folder, folder also contains "./start-all" script.

**Note:** may need to change the Cluster IPs from "10.96" to "10.43" of "msm-controller-scv.yaml", "msm-gateway.yaml", "rtsp-svc.yaml", "webhook.yaml"
and may also need to change the nodeSelector from "" to "true" in "msm-controller.yaml" and "webhook.yaml"

example:

 From: 

``` nodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""```

To:

```nodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: "true"```

## Testing Internal Client(s)

Bash into Client Pod

```kubectl exec -it 'CLIENT_POD_NAME' --  bash```

Start Streamimg

```ffmpeg -i rtsp://IP_OF_SERVER_POD:554/mystream -c copy output.mp4```

## Testing External Client(s)

RUN port forwarding to test outside kubernetes/k3d cluster

```kubectl port-forward service/mystream 8080:554```

Open VLC

Open Network source

```rtsp://FORWARDING_IP:8080/mystream```
